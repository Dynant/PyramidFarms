# Pyramid Farms
Minecraft 1.19 Datapack to turn your Pyramids (Desert and Jungle) into Sand and Gravel Farms.

## Desert Pyramid: Sand
Inside the Desert Pyramid we spawn custom Husks. The husks will drop by default 0-2 sand when they die and 0-1 extra for each looting level.

## Jungle Pyramid: Gravel
Inside a Jungle Pyramid we spawn custom Strays. The strays will drop by default 0-3 gravel when they die and 0-1 extra for each looting level.

# Installation
Download the latest release zip. Unpack the zip file and move the `pyramid-farms-sand` and/or `pyramid-farms-gravel` directories inside your `[world directory]/datapack` directory

Open Minecraft, load your world and run `/reload` to load the datapack.

# Update
Follow the same instructions as in Installation and replace the `pyramid-farms-(sand/gravel)` directories with the newly downloaded version. After that run `/reload` inside the game.

# Customize
If you want to change the drop amount, you can edit the loot table files inside the `pyramid-farms-(sand-gravel)/loot_tables` directory

# Known bug
Sometimes a jockey would spawn in the bounding box and will not be replaced correctly.

# Older Minecraft version
If you want to use this datapack for minecraft 1.15 - 1.18 you can [download release version 1.0.1](https://github.com/Dynant/PyramidFarms/releases/tag/v1.0.1)
